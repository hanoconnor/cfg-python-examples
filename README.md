# CFG Python & Apps Examples
 This repo contains examples and resoucres that I have put together as a Lead Instructor for the CFG Python & Apps course <br><br>
 These example solutions are not the only solutions. There are often multiple ways to approach a problem. However, I have designed these examples to focus on the course content to consolidate learning. <br><br>
 <i>Please note: These examples and resources are my original work/code and are just designed to support students taking the CFG Python & Apps course. This repo does not include any CFG materials to protect their content and course materials.</i>
